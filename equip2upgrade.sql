Define what chemistry is\r\n\r\nB. Explain why we study chemistry\r\n\r\nC. Explain the scientific methods\r\n\r\nD. And describe the applications of chemistry in our day to\r\nday life.\r\n\r\nDid you know that chemistry is as old as man himself? Chemistry\r\nbegan the moment our ancestors became human.\r\n\r\nPeople associate certain images with chemistry, images like\r\na man/woman in a lab coat, like mine here (smiles), the periodic table, vials\r\nof chemicals etcetera.\r\n\r\nChemistry is a science, it is one of the physical sciences\r\nthat brings with it an explanation to the world in which we live. It is\r\ninvolved in everything we do such as cooking, burning firewood, cleaning, rusting\r\nnails, lighting a match etc. Every material we see around us is made up of\r\nmatter, our bodies inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn chemistry one thing we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll talk about frequently is chemicals.\r\nNow, chemicals simply put are all forms of matter whether they be natural or artificial.\r\n\r\nSo what is chemistry? Chemistry is a branch of science that\r\ndeals with the study of matter it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s structure composition properties and the\r\nchanges it undergoes. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Do\r\nyou have mass? Do you occupy space? Then you are matter.\r\n\r\nWe study Chemistry to understand the behavior of matter under\r\ndifferent conditions. The study of chemistry helps us to understand our world. It\r\nalso enables us to acquire scientific skills, which in turn helps us to become problem\r\nsolvers. Wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t you like to be a problem solver? Chemistry can help you\r\nbecome a critical thinker which will improve your problem solving skills. So, do\r\nyou see now that studying chemistry is fun! because in it we explore our world,\r\nwe delve into understanding the world and principles of how it operates. Never consider\r\nchemistry to be just another boring science course, because it is of paramount importance\r\nto our lives and our world today!\r\n\r\nThe branches of chemistry, include:\r\n\r\nAnalytical chemistry\r\n\r\nPhysical chemistry\r\n\r\nOrganic chemistry\r\n\r\nInorganic chemistry\r\n\r\nBio-chemistry\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical chemistry\r\n\r\nEnvironmental chemistry\r\n\r\nPetroleum chemistry\r\n\r\nAstronomical chemistry etcetera.\r\n\r\nSo you see, chemistry has several career paths that one can follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scientific method\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered what happens to water when salt is\r\nadded to it? Do you think it freezes faster or not? You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re thinking like a\r\nscientist. \r\n\r\nChemistry alongside other fields of science has developed a\r\nmeans to make discoveries. This method is known as the scientific method.\r\nScientific method can be applied to everyday problems. It is a method of\r\ninvestigation, involving experimentation and observation to acquire new\r\nknowledge, to solve problems, and answer questions that are posed.\r\n\r\nThe Steps in the Scientific Method include:\r\n\r\nStep 1: Observations: scientists are very alert and inquisitive.\r\nTherefore, they observe and see certain patterns around us leading to a set of\r\nproblems which they try to solve. When you try to discover what happens to that\r\nsalt water solution, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re being observant, just like a scientist!\r\n\r\nStep 2: Hypothesis: suggest a possible solution or explanation.\r\nA suggested solution is called a hypothesis. We have 2 kinds of hypothesis, the\r\nnull hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. Take the salt water analogy for\r\ninstance, you put forth a hypothesis. The null hypothesis is that there will be\r\nno difference in how long it takes the water to freeze, whether or not it has salt\r\nadded to it. The alternative hypothesis is that there will be a significant\r\ndifference in freezing time between the two scenarios (with salt and or without\r\nsalt). \r\n\r\nStep 3: Experiment: test the hypothesis by making new\r\nobservations. You do this by carrying out experiments to test and record\r\nresults. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go back to our salt water analogy. Fill two similar containers\r\nwith the same amount of water at same temperatures, preferably room temperature.\r\nAdd a measured amount of salt to one of the containers. Place the two\r\ncontainers in a freezer. At regular intervals, open the freezer and observe the\r\nstatus of the water in each container. Continue until both have frozen\r\ncompletely. Write down the time it took for each container of water to reach a\r\nfully frozen state. This is known as the experiment and results stage.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Theory: this is an idea suggested that explains an experiment.\r\nIf the new observations support the hypothesis - whether the null or alternative\r\nhypothesis- you accept the hypothesis for further testing, this is because\r\nscientists are meticulous and try to eliminate errors. If the new observations\r\ndo not agree with your hypothesis, add the new observations to your observation\r\nlist and return to Step 3 and carry out the experiment again. A theory is\r\nusually testable, if it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t explain the hypothesis it can be modified or discarded\r\nto form a new one.\r\n\r\nUses and applications of chemistry.\r\n\r\nChemistry has made great contributions to several fields all\r\nin the bid to improve our quality of life. These fields include:\r\n\r\nAgriculture: study of chemistry has led to improvement in\r\nfarming techniques to provide improved seedlings for the production of valuable,\r\nhealthy, highly disease-resistant crop for both human and animal consumption. Similarly\r\nimproved breeds of animals are produced through chemical technology. These new\r\ntechnology has replaced the crude and uncivilized way of farming. \r\n\r\nHousing: through chemical technologies houses are\r\nconstructed with cement blocks, burnt bricks enforced with iron rods,\r\ngalvanized corrugated roofing sheets having tiles and marble floors in order to\r\nmake living comfortable and protecting one from adverse effect of climate\r\nconditions. These new technology has replaced mud housing built with thatched\r\nroofs. \r\n\r\nClothing and Textile: a wide range of clothing materials\r\nhave been made available as a result of intensive chemical research. This has\r\nreplaced the old and crude way of cloth making with hands, to cloth making with\r\nsophisticated machines. \r\n\r\nWarfare: territories are protected from insurgents or\r\nenemies by the use of sophisticated weapons engineered through technology. Such\r\nweapons include guns, ballistic missiles, bombs, landmine, biological weapons\r\netc. These weapons have replaced crude weapons such as spears, clubs, catapults,\r\nknives and arrows. \r\n\r\nMedicine: through chemical technology drugs are synthesized\r\ninto sizable quantities to be consumed orally or injected to cure one ailment\r\nor the other. Through these improved medical facilities, the lifespan of humans\r\nare now prolonged mortality rate has reduced considerately hence leading to\r\noverpopulation of the human race. These technological Innovations replaced the\r\nuse of crude herbs and other medical practices.\r\n\r\nTransportation: in ancient times movement from one place to\r\nanother was basically on land and Water by means of Beast of Burden like; donkeys,\r\nhorses, camels etc as well as trekking and use of canoes, boats and water ways.\r\nToday the transportation industry has been revolutionized. One can travel now from\r\none end of the world to another within a matter of hours.\r\n\r\nNow, the day to day applications of chemistry consists of\r\ndaily activities such as:\r\n\r\nBurning a candle\r\n\r\nUse of batteries in devices\r\n\r\nCooking with firewood, kerosene and or gas\r\n\r\nUse of soap whether for washing or bathing\r\n\r\nBoiling and frying food in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nDemerits of chemistry. \r\n\r\nNow we all know everything with a plus side, also has a down\r\nside, and chemistry isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t excluded. The disadvantages of chemistry are hazardous\r\nand have adverse effects on living and non living things. These include:\r\n\r\nCorrosion: this is the process of gradually destroying materials\r\n(usually a metal) by chemical and/or electrochemical reactions with their\r\nenvironment. These materials when exposed to the atmosphere and water rust,\r\nbringing about degradation. In order to prevent corrosion or rusting, these\r\nmaterials are either protected by coating or replaced all together, this leads\r\nto additional costs.\r\n\r\nPollution: the plastics you see around that litter the\r\nenvironment are not biodegradable, meaning they cannot be decomposed by\r\nbiological activities, this causes soil pollution. Petrochemical industries\r\ndump chemical wastes which causes water and soil pollution. The exhaust of\r\nvehicles emit harmful gases like carbon monoxide, causing air pollution.\r\n\r\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s do a quick recap of what we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve learnt today. In summary\r\nwe learnt that:\r\n\r\nA. Scientists use experiments to test their ideas\r\n\r\nB. A hypothesis is brought forward before experiments are\r\ncarried out to suggest a possible explanation.\r\n\r\nC. Chemistry like every other thing has down sides to it.\r\n\r\nD. And my personal favourite, chemistry is fun and an\r\nessential science course for our world today.\r\n\r\nI would like you to take some minutes to answer the\r\nfollowing questions to test your knowledge of today\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lesson. \r\n\r\n1. What is chemistry?\r\n\r\n2. Explain why we study chemistry. \r\n\r\n3. List the scientific methods in their order and explain\r\nthem\r\n\r\n4. Describe at least four applications of chemistry to man.\r\n\r\nSee you in my next lesson, bye!', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er-l_GlJa2k', 'page', '1613242851Generic UP Web Merchant Integration Guide.pdf', 1, '46', '44ef829c-3487-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2021-02-24 16:40:44', '', 0),

We also briefly talked about matter. Today we\\\'ll be focusing on matter, its nature and properties. Also we\\\'ll focus on elements, compounds and mixtures. Sit tight, cos this module promises to be interesting.There are varying number of substances across the globe with different properties - be it physical or chemical - these substances exhibit different states, that is the solid liquid and gaseous states. We\\\'ll be considering these states in another lesson. In this lesson however, we\\\'re gonna be dealing with matter, and at the end of the lesson, you should be able to:A. Identify what matter is and is not.B. Describe the properties of matter.&amp;nbsp;C. Explain what elements, compounds and mixtures are.What is matter?Matter as we defined in our last class is anything that has mass and occupies space. All forms of matter are chemical substances which are of two types, the physical and chemical types. By this definition its obvious to us that almost everything we see on earth consists of matter. Take an apple for instance, it has mass seeing as you can weigh it on a weighing balance and in turn record its value. It also occupies space, this is because if you place the apple in a bowl, it covers a certain volume of that bowl. This goes to show that an apple is an example of matter.The mass of an object is expressed as the quantity of matter an object contains and is the same everywhere in the world. If I measure a certain substance\\&quot;A\\&quot; in Nigeria and I measure that same substance in Kenya, the substance will have the same mass. Its weight on the other hand could vary.Properties of Matter.To identify a substance, we look at its features, characteristics or properties. Properties of Matter include factors that can be measured, such as height, mass, length, density etc. We have two types, the physical and chemical properties of matter.Physical properties.Physical property or Extrinsic property as the name implies, is the morphological appearance of matter which includes colour, taste, solubility, density etc. These properties can be observed with our eyes.For example, Oxygen gas has the following physical properties:It is colourless, odourless and tasteless&amp;nbsp;It is soluble in waterIt is 21% abundant in natureChemical properties.Chemical properties or Intrinsic properties are properties that cannot be seen with our physical eye, but are inherent within the matter under observation. These properties represent the true nature of matter. These properties include: action on litmus, reaction with metals and non-metals etc.For example, the chemical properties of Oxygen gas includes:Their reaction with metal: oxygen reacts with metals to form their oxides.Action on litmus paper: oxygen is neutral to litmus paper&amp;nbsp;Reaction with non-metals: oxygen reacts with non-metals like carbon to form carbon monoxide etc.&amp;nbsp;Changes in NatureChanges occur daily in nature, these can be classified into two main types:Physical change and&amp;nbsp;Chemical changePhysical change: a physical change is one that can be easily reversed and in which there\\\'s no formation of new substances. Matter exists in three different states, solid, liquid and gas. You can obviously see that the tea you had for breakfast is liquid, and this can be changed to a different state by application or removal of heat. Take water for instance, when you heat it up,&amp;nbsp; it begins to evaporate when it reaches boiling point - it changes to gas - this same water can be put in a freezer, thus it changes to solid. All these change of states can be easily reversed and doesn\\\'t call for the formation of a new substance.Therefore, physical changes include: melting of solids to liquids, freezing of liquids to solids, sublimation of solids to gas, vapourization of liquids to gas, dissolution of common salt in water etc.Chemical change: a chemical change is one which is not easily reversed, and new substances are always formed. If you burn a piece of wood, it decomposes eventually. Can you reverse this reaction? That\\\'s a big no. You cannot turn the Ash and gases that are now byproducts back to the initial wood. Another example is rusting of iron, a burnt matchstick etc. These are all irreversible reactions.In summary the comparing properties of physical and chemical changes are:S/NPhysical Changes&amp;nbsp;Chemical Changes1It is easily reversibleIt is not easily reversible&amp;nbsp;2No formation of new substance&amp;nbsp;New substances are formed here3No mass change in the substance&amp;nbsp;The substance changes in mass4No considerable amount of heat change is involved, the heat change is latent ie hidden.&amp;nbsp;There is a considerable amount of heat change involved.&amp;nbsp;Elements.Elements consists of the building blocks of other substances in nature. Scientists over the years have discovered a little over a hundred elements, 94 of which are found occurring naturally in nature, such as metals which can be mined and extracted from their ores and others that do not occur naturally, these are made in the laboratory.As of this year, the year 2020, there are 118 known elements. Elements are grouped in what we call a periodic table. Elements are generally grouped into 4, namely:MetalsNon - metalsMetalloids&amp;nbsp;Nobel gases or rage gases. We will be exploring this topic at a later time.So, an element is a substance which cannot be split into simpler units by an ordinary chemical process. Imagine trying to split Nitrogen through physical means, impossible right?!Compounds.A compound is a chemical substance formed when two or more elements are chemically combined in a fixed proportion by mass. Take the water molecule for instance, it is chemically denoted as H2O. That is, it has 2 molecules of hydrogen and 1 molecule of oxygen. Therefore, the proportion by mass of the water molecule is 2:1. The elements, oxygen and hydrogen are combined by chemical means, so to separate it we will have to implore chemical processes.&amp;nbsp;A substance is formed as a result of a chemical change and usually has different properties from those of the substance it was formed from.Therefore, a compound is simply defined as a substance which contains two or more elements chemically combined together.Examples of compounds include:S/NCompoundsChemical formularConstituent elements1.&amp;nbsp;WaterH2OHydrogen and oxygen&amp;nbsp;2.Ammonia&amp;nbsp;NH3Nitrogen and hydrogen.&amp;nbsp;3.Limestone [calcium carbonate (IV)]&amp;nbsp;CaCO3&amp;nbsp;Calcium, carbon and oxygen.&amp;nbsp;4.Sand (Silicon dioxide)&amp;nbsp;SiO2Silicon and oxygen.&amp;nbsp;5.Sulphuric acid or Tetraoxosulphate(IV) acidH2SO4Hydrogen, sulphur and oxygen.&amp;nbsp;Mixtures.A mixture contains two or more constituents, physically combined together. A mixture unlike compounds are combined physically and thus are easily separable. A mixture can be homogeneous, this is one that is uniformly blended together, examples are blood, urine, sweat etc. Or it can be heterogeneous, that is one that is not uniformly blended together, this mixture is in layers of different constituents, examples starch, milk, limestone solution etc.Constituents of mixture.S/NTypesMixtureConstituents1.HomogeneousBloodWater, haemoglobin, fat, oil, blood cells, sugar, protein, hormones, mineral salt, vitamins, enzymes.2.UrineUrea, water, mineral salt.3.SweatAmmonium salt, water4.HeterogeneousStarchStarch, water5.&amp;nbsp;MilkWater, sugar, vitamins fat, protein, mineral salt.6.Limestone solution&amp;nbsp;Limestone (Calcium trioxocarbonate(IV) and water.Comparison of compounds and mixturesS/NCompoundMixture1.Can be separated by chemical meansCan be separated by physical means.&amp;nbsp;2.&amp;nbsp;It is always homogeneousIt can be homogeneous or heterogeneous.&amp;nbsp;3.&amp;nbsp;It can be represented by a chemical formular because its constituents are in a fixed proportion by massIt cannot be represented by a chemical formular because constituents are combined in different proportion by mass.&amp;nbsp;4.The property of a compound is entirely different from those if its constituent elements&amp;nbsp;The property of a mixture is the sum total of its constituents.&amp;nbsp;In summary, we learnt that:1. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space, it has varying properties, both chemical and physical properties.2. An element is a substance which cannot be split into simpler units by an ordinary chemical process. Imagine trying to split Nitrogen through physical means, impossible right?!3. A compound is simply defined as a substance which contains two or more elements chemically combined together.4. A mixture contains two or more constituents, physically combined together.&amp;nbsp;I encourage you to answer the questions below to ensure mastery of this lesson.&amp;nbsp;1. What is matter?2. What are the properties of matter, both physical and chemical?&amp;nbsp;3. Describe elements, compounds and mixtures in your own words.I hope you enjoyed this lesson like I did.

', 'a506b40d-3482-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', 'Atoms, molecules and ionsHello and welcome back!In our last lesson we looked at matter, its properties, elements, compounds and mixtures. Today we\\\'ll be focusing on atoms, molecules and ions. We\\\'ll also be looking at the Dalton\\\'s atomic theory and it\\\'s modification.At the end of the lesson, you should be able to:1. Explain what atoms molecules and ions are2. State the postulates of Dalton\\\'s atomic theory3. Explain the modifications to the atomic theory.Before we begin, remember from our last lesson that an element is a substance that can be split into simpler units by an ordinary physical process. And a compound is substance that consists of two or more elements chemically combined together.Atoms.Substances can be split into really tiny particles again and again. Take an apple for instance, if you divide it in two and you divide one half of it in two and pick another half to divide in two and you continue the process, there will almost always be a tiny particle to divide. Each of these tiny particles have the same properties with the whole apple ie. both the small and big apple all have the same constituents in them, its just that they both have it in different quantities. I want you to imagine that whole apple as an element, the atoms of that element is the little pieces of the apple. Meaning the tiny apple piece is the atom and the big whole apple is the element. That\\\'s why we hear things like, the atom of an element.Element - the big whole (apple)Atom - the tiny apple piece.Just as the basic units that make up the whole apple is the little pieces, so also the basic unit that makes up an element is an atom(s).Therefore, an atom is the smallest particle of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction. So, no matter how tiny atoms are, they each still have the properties of that element, such that they can take part in a chemical reaction.&amp;nbsp;Molecules.&amp;nbsp;Imagine I have a substance like garri in a bowl, and I scooped some of it. The scooped one in my hand still has the same chemical properties as the rest in the bowl. A molecule is like the garri in the bowl with multiple scoops of garri. These scoops can have the same or different particle size.A molecule is therefore, the smallest particle of a substance that can exist alone and still retain the chemical properties of that substance.Atoms generally cannot exist alone, they need other atoms to bond with to form a molecule. So we could have molecules from the same element, or different types of elements. A good example is the oxygen gas molecule and the water molecule. On the one hand the oxygen gas is made up of two oxygen atoms - same types of elements - on the other hand the water molecule is made up of hydrogen and oxygen - two different types of elements.The number of atoms in each molecule of an element is called the atomicity of that element. Gaseous elements are usually diatomic, meaning they have 2 atoms. Neon (Ne) for example has an atomicity of 1, hydrogen (H2) an atomicity of 2, ozone (O3) an atomicity of 3, Phosphorus (P4) an atomicity of 4, and Sulphur (S8) an atomicity of 8.Let\\\'s calculate the atomicity of the following molecules:1. Aluminium oxide (Al2O3)Aluminium has 2 atoms and oxygen gas 3 atom, making it a total of 5 atoms.2. Tetraoxosulphate(VI) acid (H2SO4)Hydrogen has 2 atoms, sulphur has 1 atom, and oxygen has 4 atoms, that makes a total of 7 atoms.Compounds generally exists as molecules. Therefore, that small particle that possess the chemical properties of a given compound is its molecules.Ions.Certain particles have charges and others do not, ions are particles that have electric charge. Ions is therefore any atom or group of atoms which possesses an electric charge. The two types of ions are the positively charged ions also known as the cations and the negatively charged ions also known as the anions.Dalton\\\'s Atomic Theory.&amp;nbsp;John Dalton in 1803, put forward a theory known as the atomic theory to explain the structure of an atom. He is regarded as the founding father of atomic discoveries, the first to elucidate the true structure of an atom. John Dalton\\\'s theory postulates that:1. All matter is made up of small indivisible particles called atoms.&amp;nbsp;2. Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed but can be changed from one form to another.&amp;nbsp;3. Atoms of the same elements are alike in every way but differ from atoms of other elements.&amp;nbsp;4. The combination of atoms is in simple ratio.&amp;nbsp;5. All chemical reactions results from the combination or the Separation of atoms.Modification of Dalton\\\'s atomic theory.We explained in our first lesson on introduction to chemistry that scientist came up with discoveries through scientific methods, the same is true for John Dalton. His atomic theory was proposed using observation, hypothesis and experiments. As a result of new discoveries Dalton\\\'s theory was found to be wanting in some areas. As a result, it was modified to what we have today.1. All matter is made up of small indivisible particles called atoms. Rutherford\\\'s discoveries proved this to be wrong. According to his discovery atom is made up of three sub-particles namely protons electrons and neutrons. This debunked the theory that atoms are made up of indivisible particles.&amp;nbsp;2. Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed but can be changed from one form to another. This postulate still holds true particularly for simple chemical reactions. In simple chemical reactions, new substances are formed, but no destruction of substances occurs. However, in complex reactions such as nuclear reactions, the nucleus of an atom of an element can be destroyed to create an atom of an entirely different element.3. Atoms of the same elements are alike in every way but differ from atoms of other elements. The discovery of isotopy as well as isotopes, shows that atoms of the same element may not exactly be alike. An isotopes of an element has same atomic number but different mass number. Chlorine for instance has two isotopes, both isotopes have atomic numbers of 17. Their mass numbers however are 35 and 37 respectively. I\\\'ll explain the concept of isotopy, better in the next lesson.4. The combination of atoms is in simple ratio. Not all compounds combine in small whole numbers, inorganic compounds generally do, with the exception of Silicon which forms very complex trioxisilicates(IV) with large numbers of atoms. Organic compounds however, contain large numbers of atoms, as much as thousands of atoms in substances such as protein fats etc.In summary, we learnt that:1. An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction.&amp;nbsp;2. A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that can exist alone and still retain the chemical properties of that substance.3. Ions are particles that have electric charge.4. Dalton\\\'s atomic theory was modified to meet new discoveries.&amp;nbsp;Before we go let\\\'s look at the following questions.1. What is an atom, molecule and ion?2. Explain Dalton\\\'s atomic theory.3. Describe the modifications made to the theory.Don\\\'t know about you, but I sure had a wonderful time today.

Describe the constituents of atoms&amp;nbsp;2. Explain the concept of isotopy&amp;nbsp;3. Solve little problems on relative atomic masses.Composition of the atom.From our last lesson we defined atom as the smallest particle of an element which can take part in a chemical reaction.&amp;nbsp;Now, an atom has two main parts: the nucleus which is the centre of the atom and the shells, which surrounds the nucleus at a defined distance.The sub - atomic particles of an atom are protons, neutrons and electrons. The Electrons which are negatively charged are found on the shells, while the protons and neutrons which are positively and neutrally (no charge) charged respectively are found in the nucleus of the atom.The proton and neutron are the nuclear particles since they are found in the nucleus of an atom. They determine the atomic number and mass number of an atom. These numbers are always whole numbers.Atomic number, mass number and Isotopy.&amp;nbsp;The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is denoted as, Z. The mass number however, is the sum of the proton and neutron numbers, in the nucleus of an atom. It is denoted as, A.Atomic number is same as the atomicity = number of protonsMass number = protons + neutronsTake Aluminum for instance, it\\\'s atomic number is 13, but it\\\'s mass number is 27, meaning that it\\\'s neutron number is 14.Mass number = protons + neutrons27 = 13 +?&amp;nbsp;Neutron = 27 - 13 = 14.Also note that the proton number and electron number of a neutral atom has the same values, the only difference is in its electric charge. Protons are positively charged while electrons are negatively charged.In summary an atom has two parts the shell carrying the Electrons which are negatively charged and the nucleus consising of the protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge).Since we now know what atoms consists of, let\\\'s briefly look at isotopy for better understanding.Isotopy: this is the occurrence or existence of two or more atoms of the same elements having the same atomic number but different mass number.Isoptopes: are atoms of the same elements with same atomic number ie. same number of protons but different mass number ie. different number of neutrons.Take the chlorine example sited earlier, their mass numbers are 35 and 37 respectively.Chlorine A has atomic number of 17 and mass number of 18.This is expressed as 35 - 17 = 18.&amp;nbsp;Therefore, chlorine A has a mass number of 18.Chlorine B has atomic number of 17 and mass number of 20.This is expressed as 35 - 17 =&amp;nbsp; 20.Therefore, chlorine B has a mass number of 20.3517 Cl&amp;nbsp; 3717 ClRelative atomic mass.&amp;nbsp;When we say something is relative it means, that thing is connected to or depending on something else. This means, it takes its bearing from it. Scientists use carbon - 12 as a reference point for measuring atomic masses. The concept of Carbon - 12 is the standard used by scientists from which atomic masses of all nuclides are measured. Therefore, its atomic mass is exactly 12 Daltons by definition. Carbon-12 has equal numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons.&amp;nbsp;Relative atomic mass is a ratio, it has no unit, rather it is expressed in unit of amount of a substance. Every isotope of an element has its own mass, this is known as the isotopic mass.Therefore, relative atomic mass of an element is defined as the weight in grams of the number of atoms of the element contained in 12.00 g of carbon-12. It is the number of times, the average mass of one atom of element is heavier than one - twelfth (1/12 th) the mass of one atom of 12 grams of carbon 12.To measure relative atomic mass of an element, we use an instrument called the mass spectrometer.There are several ways to calculate the relative atomic mass using isotopes:Percentage abundance givenRelative atomic mass = [mass number of the first isotope X its abundance / 100 + mass number of the second isotope X its abundance / 100] + depending on the number of isotopes.&amp;nbsp;Ratio givenRelative atomic mass = [mass number of isotope X its ratio / total ratio + mass number of the second isotope X its ratio / total ratio] + depending on the number of isotopes.&amp;nbsp;Let\\\'s look at the following examples.&amp;nbsp;1. Chlorine exist in isotopic mixtures of 3517 Cl and 3717 Cl with a relative abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. What is the relative atomic mass of chlorine?Solution.Relative atomic mass = [mass number of isotope X its abundance / 100]+ depending on the number of isotopes.Relative atomic mass, RAM =?&amp;nbsp;Mass no of the 1st isotope = 35, its abundance = 75%Mass number of the 2nd isotope =37, it\\\'s abundance = 25%RAM = [35 X 75 / 100] + [37 X 25 / 100]= 2625 / 100 + 925 / 100= 26.25 + 9.25 = 35.52. Chlorine exist as 35 and 37 with the relative atomic mass of 35.5. Calculate the relative percentage abundance of the two isotopes.Solutions.Relative atomic mass = [mass number of isotope X its abundance / 100]+ depending on the number of isotopes.Relative atomic mass, RAM = 35.5&amp;nbsp;Mass no of the 1st isotope = 35, let its abundance be = x%Mass number of the 2nd isotope =37, let it\\\'s abundance = 100 - x %35.5 = [35 X x / 100] + [37 X 100 - x / 100]35.5 = 35x / 100 + 37(100 - x) / 10035.5 = 0.35x + 0.37 (100 - x)35.5 = 0.35x + 37 - 0.37x35.5 - 0.37 = 0.35x - 0.37x-1.5 = - 0.02xX = 1.5 / 0.02 = 75%The percentage of Chlorine 35 is 75%The percentage of chlorine 37 is (100 - x)&amp;nbsp;100 - 75) = 25%In summary we learnt that:1. Atoms has two main parts, the nucleus and the shell. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons and the shell has electrons orbiting it.2. Relative atomic mass is a ratio, it has no unit, rather it is expressed in unit of amount of a substance.3. Isotopy is the occurrence or existence of two or more atoms of the same elements having the same atomic number but different mass number.Before we go, here are some practice questions.1. What are the constituents of atoms?2. Describe the concept of isotopy.3. Chlorine atoms exist with a mass number 35 and 37 in the ratio of 3 : 1. Calculate the relative atomic mass of chlorine.I encourage you to solve as many questions as possible on relative atomic mass.I had a swell time. Did you?

Join me today, as we deal with the relative molecular mass, mole and the molar mass. At the end of this lesson its expected that you should be able to:1. Explain the relative molecular mass and solve questions on it.2. Describe the mole concept and solve problems relating to it.3. Explain molar mass and solve problems related to it.Relative molecular mass.&amp;nbsp;In our last lesson we defined the relative atomic mass as the number of times, the average mass of one atom of element is heavier than one - twelfth (1/12 th) the mass of one atom of 12 grams of carbon 12 (isotope).The relative molecular mass is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in one molecule of that substance. The relative molecular mass is culled from the relative atomic mass.&amp;nbsp;Therefore, the relative molecular mass is the&amp;nbsp; number of times, the average mass of one molecule of element is heavier than one - twelfth (1/12 th) the mass of one molecule of 12 grams of carbon 12 (isotope).Mole.Think of a mole as a currency, the mole is an amount of a substance and a currency whatever the currency may be, is the purchasing power. Take the Naira for instance. A Naira = 100 kobos. So if we want to know how many kobos we have in 10 Naira, we\\\'ll multiply by a hundred, that will give us a thousand kobos. So also, if we want to know how many Naira we have in 3500 kobo, we divide by a hundred, which will yield 35 Naira.Just like Naira which is measured in kobo, Mole is measured in terms of the number of particles of a substance. A mole is a convenient method of expressing the amount of a substance. It is the unit of measurement for amount of substance in the International System of Units.One mole of a substance is the amount containing as many elementary entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon 12.&amp;nbsp;Therefore, a mole of a substance or a mole of particles is defined as exactly 6.02Ã—10Â²Â³ particles, which may be atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons. Simply put 1 mol = 6.02Ã—10Â²Â³ particles.One mole of a substance is one particle, whether its a molecule - whole or not - an atom or ions.This, H- &amp;nbsp;is one molecule of hydrogen ionNH3 is one mole of ammonia molecule containing, one mole of Nitrogen and one mole of hydrogen6K is 6 moles of potassium atom&amp;nbsp;3N2 is 3 moles of Nitrogen molecules or 6 molecules of Nitrogen atom.Molar mass.&amp;nbsp;The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance expressed in grams. It is expressed as g/mol. Therefore the molar mass of an element, is its relative atomic mass expressed in grams and the molar mass of a compound, is its relative molecular mass expressed in grams.Formula\\\'s connecting moles and molar mass:1 mole of a substance is = its molar massExamples:1. Calculate the molar mass and the relative molecular mass of tetraoxosulphate(VI) acid, H2SO4. (H = 1, S = 32, O = 16)Solution.&amp;nbsp;H2SO4 = [1 x 2 + 32 + 16 x 4]= 2 + 32 +64= 98The molar mass is 98 g/mol and the relative molecular mass is 98, this is because molar mass is expressed in g/mol and relative molecular mass has no unit.2. How many moles are in 3.89g of ammonia, NH3? (N = 14, H = 1)Reacting mass = 3.89 gMolar mass of NH3 = 14 + 3 x 1 = 17 g/mol=&amp;nbsp; 0.228&amp;nbsp;= 0.23 mol&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ORIf 1 mole of NH3 = 17 gX mole = 3.89 g=&amp;nbsp; 0.228&amp;nbsp;= 0.23 molMolar - Volume relationship.Calculate the volume present in 2.4g of sulphur(IV) oxide, SO2. (S = 32, O = 16).Equating both equations we have that:&amp;nbsp;Reacting mass = 2.4 gMolar mass of SO2 = 32 + 2 x 16 = 64 g/molReacting vol =?Molar vol = 22.4 dm3 (constant: gases at s.t.p occupy a volume of 22.4 dm3).&amp;nbsp;= 0.84 dm3.Let\\\'s take a recap of today\\\'s lesson, we learnt that:1. The relative molecular mass is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in one molecule of that substance.&amp;nbsp;2. One mole of a substance is the amount containing as many elementary entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon 12.&amp;nbsp;3. The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance expressed in grams. It is expressed as g/mol.Before we conclude, please answer the following questions:1. Define and explain the relative molecular mass, mole and the molar mass.2. Calculate the molar mass and the relative molecular mass of MgSO4 and Ca(HCO3)2. (Mg = 24, S = 32, O = 16, Ca = 40, H = 1, C =12).3. How many moles are in 8.3g of Carbon(IV)oxide, CO2?

It expresses the simplest ratio of the element of a compound.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The following are steps taken in deriving the empirical formula of a compound;Step 1: calculate the percentage composition of each element of the compound if it\\\'s not given, for a carbohydrate for instance. This an organic compound containing three elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen in which hydrogen and oxygen combine in the ratio 2 is to 1 as in water. Step 2: divide each percentage composition of each element by their respective atomic masses.Step 3: divide through by the smallest decimal fractions and write their ratios.Note: if the ratio of any of the elements is in decimal place such as 0.5 1.5 2.5 etc. do not approximate to the nearest whole number but rather multiply each ratio by 2 for every other ratio approximate to the nearest whole number.Step 4: take the whole number as a subscript of each chemical symbol of each elements to give the empirical formula.Molecular formula.The molecular formula of a compound is the actual formula of a compound. It is expressed as the actual mass of element as contained in a compound.To calculate the molecular formula the following steps are taken:Step 1: calculate the empirical formula of the compoundSteps 2: calculate the positive integer, n from the expression&amp;nbsp;ORStep 3: substitute the positive integer, n with the expression below and multiply it with the subscript of the empirical formula to give the molecular formula.&amp;nbsp;Example.An organic compound contains 40% of carbon 6.67% of hydrogen and the rest is oxygen having a relative molecular mass of 60.

The Electron in an incompletely filled outer shell of an atom is called valence electron.&amp;nbsp; Atoms combine because of valence electrons. They do so to fulfill the duptet and octet rule. Because atoms are supposed to have two electrons or eight electrons respectively on its outermost shell to be balanced an atom with less than eight electrons in its outermost shell, is imbalanced.We have two kinds of elements, reactive and unreactive elements.If you have an ice cream cone, I hope you know that the tendency of the ice cream to melt is high particularly on hot days. The reactive elements are like the melted ice cream, which is incomplete (on its surface). So also, reactive elements have incomplete electrons on its outermost shell.The unreactive elements are known as noble gases or the rare gases. They have complete number of outer shell electrons and are therefore stable.&amp;nbsp;Valency is the combining power of an element. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have the same valency. And a valence electron is an outer shell electron of an atom that can participate in the formation of a chemical bond.To write the valency of an element the outermost electrons or valence electrons is considered after distributing the electrons in shell.&amp;nbsp; Electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom in elliptical orbits called shells or energy levels. The shells or energy levels are lettered K, L, M, N... being the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th... shells of the nucleus respectively. The maximum number of electrons in each shell is assigned a formula 2n2 where â€˜nâ€™ is the position of the shell.Note: according to IUPAC (international union of pure and applied chemists) the M shell should contain a maximum of eight electrons for the first 30 elements. The noble, rare or inert gases are the most unreactive elements of the periodic table. This is because they have attained a complete octet configuration (8 valence electron configuration) with the exception of Helium atom which has the duptet configuration (2 valence electron configuration).Octet ruleThe octet rule states that elements will attain stability by giving out or accepting electrons to attain the eight valence configuration or the two valence configuration of the noble gases or the Helium atom respectively.If an element gives out electrons it becomes positively charged because the number of protons are more than the number of electrons. Hence the majority of charge carriers are positive charges. Similarly if an element accepts electrons it becomes negatively charged because the number of electrons is more than the number of protons. Hence the majority of charge carriers are negative charges.This can be simply illustrated with the principle of giving. It is often said that it is better to give than to receive, and it is also a common saying that givers never lack. So the element that gives electrons to another becomes positively charged and the one that receives electrons from another element becomes negatively charged.Balancing of Chemical Equations.Before we dive right in, what is a chemical equation?A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction in the form of symbols and formulae, where the reactant entities are on the left-hand side and the product entities on the right-hand side.A chemical equation is like seesaw swing. I\\\'m sure you know what a seesaw is. It\\\'s that two - person seat, composed of a plank, balanced in the middle, used as a game in which one person goes up as the other goes down; a teeter-totter. It is common on most playgrounds. In a chemical equation we have both the reactants and products side just like the seesaw, and both sides want to be properly comfortable i.e. balanced.Remember in our lesson on the modifications to Daltonâ€™s atomic theory, we looked at the law of Conservation of matter which states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. An unbalanced chemical equation shows that atoms have being created or destroyed. Therefore in other to obey the law of conservation of matter all chemical equations must be properly balanced.In balancing chemical equations, the following rules must be adhered to:Do not for any reason touch the formulae of the reactants and productsBalance the reaction by adding to the number of moles of the reactant and product sideDo a count to ensure that the number of atoms of a certain element at the reactant side equals that on the product side.Here are some examples.Balance the following chemical equations:1. Let\\\'s begin with a simple one, the formation of water molecule.H2(g) + O2(g) - H2O(l)All of the reactants and product have a coefficient of 1. Therefore weâ€™ll start by adding 2 to hydrogen on the LHS while also trying to balance the number of hydrogen on the RHS with whatever number that is suitable.2H2(g) + O2(g)  H2O(l)The hydrogen on the LHS is 4 and on the RHS is 2, to balance it out we add 2, to the one on the RHS.2H2(g) + O2(g)  2H2O(l)Next thing we do is to look at the other reactants and products. In this case we have no other product, the reactants on the other hand is 2. We have dealt with the hydrogen gas, the other one is the oxygen gas and it is seen to be balanced both on the LHS and RHS. In total we have 2 oxygen on the LHS and 2 oxygen on the RHS.Therefore the balanced chemical equation of that reaction is;2H2(g) + O2(g)  2H2O(l)2. Methane gas and oxygen gas combines to give us carbon dioxide and water molecule.CH4(g) + O2(g) &amp;nbsp; CO2(g) + H2O(g)Carbon has the same value on the LHS and RHS.Hydrogen on the other hand is 4 on the LHS and 2 on the RHS. Therefore we add 2 to the water molecule to balance the number of hydrogen on both sides. We now haveCH4(g) + O2(g)  CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)Oxygen is 2 on the LHS and 4 in total on the RHS, it is 4 because, in carbon dioxide oxygen is 2 and in water, oxygen is 2, making a total of 4. Therefore we add 2 to the oxygen gas on the LHS to balance the number of oxygen on both sides. We now have;CH4(g) + 2O2(g)  CO2(g) +2 H2O(g)Therefore the balanced chemical equation of that reaction is;CH4(g) + 2O2(g)  CO2(g) +2 H2O(g)Note: ionic chemical equations can also be balanced, we will study this at a later time.&amp;nbsp;Importance of a chemical equation.&amp;nbsp;The importance of chemical equations cannot be overemphasized. Its importance are:a. It helps us to see the reactants and products involved in a reaction. The reactants are located on the left hand side (LHS) and the products on the right hand side (RHS) of the reaction.b. It tells us to know the direction of the reaction, whether the reaction is reversible or irreversible.c. It also tells us the different elements and radicals involved in the reaction.d. It gives us the states of matter in which the substances are in for example liquid, solid or gaseous states.In summary we learnt that:Empirical formula is the simplest formula of a compound and molecular formula is the actual formula of a compound.The mathematical relationship between empirical formula and the molecular formula is given as molecular formula = (empirical formula)nValency&amp;nbsp; is the combining power of an element .Balancing of chemical equations is very important because an unbalanced chemical equation shows that atoms have been created or destroyed which is impossible.Before we leave let\\\'s take these questions :What is empirical and molecular formula and valency?State the importance of balancing chemical equations.An compound contains 29.11% of sodium 40.51% of sulphur and the rest is oxygen. It has a vapor density of 79. Calculate its empirical formula and molecular formula respectively.&amp;nbsp;(Na = 23, S = 32, 0 = 16).As much as you can, solve questions relating to empirical formula, molecular formula and balancing of chemical equations.See you some other time.&amp;nbsp;', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCJrslEGZA', 'page', '', 1, '', '03983c09-348e-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2021-02-24 16:40:44', '', 0),

At the end of the lesson you should be able to:1. Determine the percentage composition by mass of compounds2. Determine the oxidation number of compounds and&amp;nbsp;3. Also describe radicals.Percentage CompositionThe percentage composition by mass of a compound helps us to determine the percentage by mass of each element present in the compound. So what we do is to get percentage composition by an individual element of the compound over all the other elements in the compound.Let\\\'s take some examples.Calculate the percentage composition by mass of sodium and oxygen in:a. NaNO3b. Na2CO3.10H2O(Given that Na = 23, N = 14, O = 16, C = 12, H = 1)a.

For instance, in Na2CO3.10H2O we can calculate the sodium, carbon, oxygen elements in the compound and also the percentage composition of the water molecule in the compound.Oxidation Number/StateThe oxidation number of an element in a compound or radical is the combining power of that element in the compound or radical. An oxidation state shows how many electrons an atom would gain or lose if it were to bond with other atoms or radicals.RadicalsA radical is a group of atoms that possess electrical charges. They are known as free radical, in chemistry. And they are molecules that contain at least one unpaired electron.Examples of radicals are:Hydroxide ion, which has a chemical formula OH-, has a valency of 1 and oxidation number of - 1.Tetraoxosulphate (VI) ion, which has a chemical formula SO42-, has a valency of&amp;nbsp; 2 and oxidation number of - 2.Consult the diagram here.&amp;nbsp;Remember, Valency is the number of electrons present in the outermost shell of a particular element whereas oxidation state is the number of electrons that an element in a particular compound has lost or gained.Therefore, Valency carries no charge but oxidation numbers always caries a positive or negative charge.&amp;nbsp;Rules for naming or assigning oxidation numberOxidation number can be assigned to elements, compounds, or radicals. Follow these rules in doing so.&amp;nbsp;1. Oxidation numbers can be positive and negative.2. The algebraic sum of all valency of elements in a compound equals zero.&amp;nbsp;3. The oxidation number of an element in an uncombined state or Free State is equal to zero.4. Oxidation number of hydrogen\\\'s in a compound is always +1 with an exception with metal hydrides like NaH where it is - 1.5. The oxidation number of oxygen in a compound is always - 2 except in peroxides like H2O2 where it is - 1.For example the oxidation states of oxygen, hydrogen, fluorine and aluminium is - 2, +1, -1 and +3 respectively. This follows rules 1, 4 and 5.Remember, most elements have the oxidation states of the group in which they fall into. For instance most group one element have an oxidation state of + 1, group 2 has that of + 2, group 3 that of + 3 and so on. Group 7 elements have the oxidation states of - 1 seeing as it gains an electron to become stable.&amp;nbsp;Let\\\'s take an example of NH3 and H2SO4.NH3 = - 3 + 3(1)= - 3 +3 = 0The oxidation number of Nitrogen varies from - 3 to +5, this is because Nitrogen can obtain a stable configuration by either gaining 3 electrons, thereby attaining oxidation state of -3, or losing all the 5 valence shell electrons, thus becoming +5.&amp;nbsp;H2SO4 = 2(1) + 6 + 4(-2)= 2 + 6 - 8 = 0This follows all the rules.Note: Some elements exhibit variable oxidation state these elements are mostly the transition elements also known as transition metals.&amp;nbsp;Let\\\'s consider the equations below:2Ho2(g) + Oo2(g) â†’ 2H+12 O2-(l)Uncombined - CombinedCa2+O2-(s) + C4+O2-2(g) â†’  Ca2+C4+O2-3(S)Combined statesNow let\\\'s calculate the oxidation states of some compounds and radicals.&amp;nbsp;1. KMnO41 + Mn + 4(-2) = 01 - 8 + Mn = 0Mn = +72. Cr2O72-2Cr + 7(-2) = - 22Cr - 14 = - 2Cr = 12/2Cr = +63. MnO42-Mn + 4(-2) = - 2Mn&amp;nbsp; - 8 = - 2Mn = 8 - 2 = +64. Fe(CN)63-Fe +6(- 1) = - 3Fe = 6 - 3 = +3We have come to the end of this lesson in summary we learnt that:The percentage composition by mass of a compound helps us to determine the percentage by mass of each element present in the compound.&amp;nbsp;Valency is the number of electrons present in the outermost shell of a particular element whereas oxidation state is the number of electrons that an element in a particular compound has lost or gained.Endeavour to solve the questions below.1.

(11, 0, 11, 1, 57, 3, 'Laws of chemical combination', 'a5072b1f-3482-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', 'Good to have you back!So far we have looked at the introduction to Chemistry, particulate nature of matter, Atoms, Moles, Formulae, Symbols and Chemical Equations.&amp;nbsp;Today we\\\'ll be focusing on the Laws of chemical combinations.At the end of the lesson you should be able to:1. State the laws of chemical combination2. Explain the laws of chemical combinations.&amp;nbsp;Let\\\'s begin.LAWS OF CHEMICAL COMBINATIONThe laws of chemical combination include;Law of conservation of mass or matterLaw of definite/constant/fixed proportionsLaw of multiple proportionsLaw of reciprocal proportionsThe law of conservation of massThis states that the total mass of a chemical system is constant or conserved. According to the law of conservation of matter, in ordinary chemical reactions matter can neither be created nor destroyed. This means the total mass of reactants in a chemical reaction equals the total mass of the products.&amp;nbsp;Heres an experiment to verify the law of conservation of mass. Mummy gives you a plate of beans and your sister a plate of rice. If you take a plate of your own beans and your sisters plate of rice and you weigh each separately on a weighing balance. You then mix them together and weigh their total sum, you will notice that the weight of each will be equal to the weight of both their sums. So also if you combine two elements like iron and sulphur,&amp;nbsp; you\\\'ll get iron sulphide. The individual masses of iron and sulphur is same as the combined mass of the iron sulphide.&amp;nbsp;Law of definite proportionsThis states that for all pure samples of the same chemical compound irrespective of the method of preparation, contain the same elements combined in the same proportion by mass.If Fola follows the standard recipe for baking a cake and Moji does the same, at the end we will have the same ratio for all the ingredients present. That is the flour to the magarine to the eggs to the sugar will all have the same values for both Fola\\\'s and Moji\\\'s cake.&amp;nbsp;So also, we know that water is always a combination of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. If we calculate the molecular mass of water we\\\'ll discover it to be 18 g/mol. By weight, we have a percentage of 11% hydrogen and 89% oxygen in one mole of water. This is in a ratio of 1:8. The Law of Definite Proportions illustrates that whatever the amount of water, the ratio of the amount of hydrogen to oxygen by weight will always be the same.Law of multiple proportionsThis is culled from Dalton\\\'s fourth law which states that atoms combine in small whole ratios. The law of multiple proportions states that if an element combines with another element to form more than one chemical compound the several masses of one element that combines with a fixed mass of another are in a simple or whole number multiple ratio.Lets take this illustration. We have different possible combinations of food. You could decide to eat rice, beans and stew with beef or jollof rice, plantain and goat meat. Just like different combinations are possible in food, different combinations are also possible for elements that make up compounds.Say we can combine element A to element B, that doesn\\\'t change the fact that, that same element A can be combined with another element C. Therefore, varying number of elements can combine with other elements to form different possible combinations.Law of reciprocal proportions&amp;nbsp;This states that if elements S, T, and U combine separately with a third element V, the ratio of the masses in which they combine are either the same or a simple multiple of the mass ratio in which they combine. The law simply means that if we know the proportion of elements in compounds ST and the proportion of elements in compounds UV, we can therefore determine the proportion of elements in compounds SV.&amp;nbsp; [ST + UV = TU + SV]Consider the equation below;2HCl(aq) + CaO(s)&amp;nbsp; CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l)1 : 35 + 20 : 8 20 : 35 + 1 : 8Look at hydrochloric acid, HCl, where the ratio is 1:35 and calcium oxide, CaO, where the ratio is 20:8. If we combine calcium and chlorine, we would expect to see a ratio of 20:35 and if we combine hydrogen and oxygen, we expect to see a ratio of 1:8. Yeah? This proves the law of reciprocal proportion to be true.Note: compounds can combine in a number of possible ways.In summary we learnt that:There are 4 laws of chemical combinationThey are, the laws of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple proportions and the law of reciprocal proportions.Make sure you learn to state each of these laws and explain them.&amp;nbsp;Be right back!&amp;nbsp;', 'nil', 'page', '', 1, '', '84e5b4d1-3495-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2021-02-24 16:40:44', '', 0),

Explain the concept of quantum numbers&amp;nbsp;2. Describe the arrangement of electrons in an atom and3. Explain the electronic configuration of elements.Let\\\'s dive right in!QUANTUM NUMBERSI\\\'m sure you remember we said in a previous lessons that the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons and electrons is found orbiting the shell. Hydrogen atom however has no neutron. The isotopes of hydrogen are hydrogen with no neutron, deuterium with one neutron, and tritium with two neutrons , they all differ. Therefore, the hydrogen atom has a nucleus which consists of one proton and an electron orbiting its shell. The hydrogen atom has a number of orbits to choose from, but it sticks to the orbit with minimum energy. As the electrons continue to absorb energy it will rise on the energy level to an excited state. Different lines are produced depending on the orbits which the electrons fall on.&amp;nbsp;The Bohr\\\'s atom is denoted by the principal quantum number, n, which is a positive integer. The minimum energy level is denoted as n = 1, the next levels are n = 2, 3, 4, 5... to infinity, and each of these numbers are represented by letters K, L, M, N...The electron energy is usually characterized by the 4 quantum numbers - these quantum numbers give a detailed description of the electrons in an atom.The 4 quantum numbers are,1. The Principal quantum number, n, has integral values of 1, 2, 3, 4... Each represented by K, L, M, N... The principal quantum number n represents the relative overall energy of each orbital. The energy level of each orbital increases as its distance from the nucleus increases. Each shell is given as 2n2 and its total number of orbitals as n2.2. The subsidiary quantum number also known as azimuthal quantum number, l, has integral values ranging from 0 to (n - 1) ie. 0, 1, 2, 3 each represented by s, p, d, f. The subsidiary quantum number shows the energy subshells in a given energy level, it explains the principal quantum numbers properly.&amp;nbsp;3. The magnetic quantum number, m, has integral values ranging from - 1 through 0 to +1. This distinguishes the orbitals available within a subshell, (the subsidiary quantum number). For example, the p subshell has 3 p orbitals.4. The spin quantum number, s, has values of - 1/2 and +1/2. This quantum number describes the angular momentum of an electrons, ie. It shows the direction of orientation of an electron. Therefore, the electrons could spin on their axis in opposite directions.Principles of electron filling into orbitalsNow that we\\\'ve established that electrons are filled into orbitals and shells. We need to consider the rules that govern this filling process. We have 3 of these rules.1. Pauli\\\'s exclusion principle: this principle states that no two electrons in the same orbital can have the same values for all 4 quantum numbers. This means that, if 2 electrons have the same value for n (principal quantum number), m (subsidiary quantum number), and l (magnetic quantum number), they will differ in s (spin quantum number). Meaning no two electrons in an atom can behave in an identical manner.2. Hund\\\'s rule: this states that electrons occupy orbitals singly first before pairing in a degenerate orbital.&amp;nbsp; All electrons in a singly occupied orbital has the same spin.3. Aufbau\\\'s principle: this states that electrons enter into orbitals in order of increasing energy, starting from the lowest to the highest. You don\\\'t for example start grade 5 before you go ahead to grade 2, you rather move in a consistently increasing rate, from lowest to the highest grade.We\\\'ll take some examples in a bit for clearer understanding.Shapes of the s and p orbitalsHave you seen a soccer ball or basketball before? Maybe on a pitch. ThatÂ’s what a sphere looks like. Have you ever been to the gym? You must have seen a dumb bell there. A dumb bell is a piece of equipment used for weight lifting. It helps to build muscle, particularly around the arms. So, the s orbital is spherical in shape, and the p orbital has a dumb bell shape. See diagrams below.ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN AN ATOM AND THE ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONThe arrangement of electrons in an atom is determined by the order of increasing energy level. Let\\\'s take a quick look at the first 20 elements of the periodic table (see diagram below).&amp;nbsp;Hydrogen has 1 electron and an atomic number of 1. Therefore the electron will occupy 1s subshell, to be 1s1. 1 is the principal quantum number, s is the subsidiary quantum number and 1, is the number of electrons of the hydrogen atom. The spin quantum number will point up, +1/2.LetÂ’s have an in-depth explanation to the 4 quantum numbers with these examples.The value of the principal quantum number, n, for K = 1, L = 2, M = 3, this follows its integral values. Note that the K shell has 2 electrons, the L shell, 8 electrons, the M shell, another 8 electrons etc. Therefore, if an element has 2 electrons, its principal quantum number will automatically be 1, if it has 6 electrons, its value will be 2, if it has 12 electrons its value will be 3. Or you could say that the coefficient of its electronic configuration is its principal quantum number.Consider the elements, Helium (He), Carbon (C), and Aluminum (Al).&amp;nbsp;In filling the electrons into its orbitals remember we must not forget the 3 rules involved.We have that;He = 1s2 having a total of 2 electrons. The value for the principal quantum number, n = 1 because the coefficient of 1s2 is 1. You can see the way the electrons are filled starting from the lowest energy level to the highest energy level, obeying Aufbau principle.C = 1s2, 2s2, 2p2 having a total of 6 electrons. The value for the principal quantum number, n = 2 because the coefficient of 2p2 is 2. You can see the way the electrons are filled starting from the lowest energy level to the highest energy level, obeying Aufbau principle. You can also see that we filled singly before coming right back to pair the electrons up, following&amp;nbsp; Hund\\\'s rule.Al = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p1 having a total of 13 electrons. The value for the principal quantum number, n = 3 because the coefficient of 3p1 is 3. You can see the way the electrons are filled starting from the lowest energy level to the highest energy level, obeying Aufbau principle. You can also see that we filled singly before coming right back to pair the electrons up, following&amp;nbsp; Hund\\\'s rule.The value of the subsidiary quantum number, l for s subshell is 0, p subshell is 1, d subshell is 2 etc. This follows its integral values. Note that the s orbital has a maximum of 2 electrons, p orbital a maximum of 6 electrons, d orbital a maximum of 10 electrons and the f orbital with a maximum of 14 electrons.Consider the elements, Helium (He), Carbon (C), and Aluminum (Al) again.He = 1s2 the value for the subsidiary quantum number, l = 0. This is because for s subshell, l is 0.C = 1s2, 2s2, 2p2 the value for the subsidiary quantum number, l = 1. This is because for p subshell, l is 1.Al = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p1 the value for the subsidiary quantum number, l = 2. This is because for d subshell, l is 2.	Note: Remember we said the integral values for the subsidiary quantum numbers are 0, 1, 2...Therefore, the values for the s subshell, l is 0, for p subshell, l is 1, for d subshell, l is 2 etc.The value for the magnetic quantum number ml, for s, when l = 0, is 0. For p, when l = 1 is 3 possible values of - 1, 0 and +1. For d, when l = 2 is 5 possible values of -2, - 1, 0, +1, +2 etc. Therefore, when filling the electrons we must follow HundÂ’s rule of filling singly before pairing.Consider the elements, Helium (He), Carbon (C), and Aluminum (Al) again.He = 1s2 the value for the magnetic quantum number, ml for s subshell which helium resides in = 0C = 1s2, 2s2, 2p2 the values for the magnetic quantum number, ml for p subshell which carbon resides in will give us 3 possible values of -1, 0 and +1.Al = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p1 the values for the magnetic quantum number, ml for p subshell which aluminum resides in will give us 3 possible values of -1, 0 and +1.Note: the value for the magnetic quantum number, ml for s subshell is 0, for p subshell, it will give us 3 possible values of -1, 0 and +1, d subshell will give us 5 possible values of -2, -1, 0 +1 and +2, f subshell will give us 7 possible values of -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 and +3.For the spin quantum number, s, we can have 2 possible values. The spin up which is +1/2and the spin down which is - 1/2.Consider the elements, Helium (He), Carbon (C), and Aluminum (Al) again.He = 1s2 the value for the spin quantum number, ms is -1/2, this is because the last electron that entered was a spin down electron.C = 1s2, 2s2, 2p2 the value for the spin quantum number, ms is +1/2, this is because the last electron that entered was a spin up electron.Al = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p1 the value for the spin quantum number, ms is +1/2, this is because the last electron that entered was a spin up electron.In summary we learnt that:There are 4 laws of chemical combinationThere are 4 quantum numbers and we discovered how to deduce themElectrons are filled following certain rules.Before we leave let\\\'s take these questions:State the 4 laws of chemical combinationDescribe the 4 quantum numbersDeduce the quantum numbers for the first 20 elements in the periodic table.Write down the electronic configuration of the first 20 elements.See you some other time.&amp;nbsp;', 'nil', 'page', '', 1, '', 'f1db0e0f-349e-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2021-02-24 16:40:44', '', 0),

The atoms of rare gases are highly stable owing to their electronic configuration, and thus don\\\'t need to bond. The atoms of other elements however, are unstable, and they try to attain stability by chemical bonding.In chemical combinations, two types of bonds are formed:The intermolecular bonds, these are mostly strong bonds andThe intramolecular bonds, these are mostly weak bonds.&amp;nbsp;The intermolecular bonds are bonds that mostly occur between atoms of different elements. These are the main types of chemical combination, they include:1. Electrovalent/ionic combination2. Covalent combination, which is classified into:a. Ordinary Covalent combinationsb. Coordinate/Dative covalent combination.The intramolecular bonds mostly occur amongst atoms of the same elements. They are:1. Hydrogen bond2. Metallic bond3. Van der Waals forces.4. Dipole - dipole interaction.&amp;nbsp;In this lesson we will be looking at the strong bonds.ELECTROVALENT COMBINATIONThe main principle here is a donor - acceptor principle in which there is a complete electron transfer.If Chika needs a kidney transplant and Kelechi happens to have 2 healthy and functional kidneys. He could decide to give up one of his kidneys for Chika in order that Chika might live a healthy life. Kelechi is seen to be the donor while Chika is the acceptor.&amp;nbsp;In this type of bonding, there is a transfer of valence electrons from an electropositive element usually a metal, to an electronegative element usually a non - metal.&amp;nbsp;I hope you can still remember what valence electrons are? They are outermost shell electrons and they take part in chemical combinations. So, Kelechi who donates is electropositive while Chika who accepts, is electronegative.&amp;nbsp;Remember we said in a previous lesson that when you give, you are said to be on the plus side, and when you receive, you\\\'re on the minus side. So next time when you see your friend who has no pen and you have 2 working pens, why don\\\'t you be a good friend and give up one of your pens?Let\\\'s take some examples.Formation of Calcium chloride, CaCl2Ca(s) + Cl2(g)  CaCl2(s)The half equation for the reaction isCa  Ca2+ - 2e-AndCl2 + 2e-  Cl2-Joining both equations, we have that;Ca + Cl2 + 2e-  Ca2+ + Cl2-- 2e-Cancelling out the electrons on both sides, we have;CaCl2  Ca2+ Cl2-In bond formation, calcium has 20 electrons leaving 2 valence electrons for bonding; chlorine however, has 17 electrons, leaving 7 valence electrons for bonding. Just as it is easier for you to give your friend 2 naira, rather than a whopping 7 naira, so also it is easier for the calcium atom to give out its 2 valence electrons, than for the chlorine atoms to give out a whopping 7 electrons.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, calcium atom donates its 2 valence electrons to the 2 chlorine atoms available, hence making the calcium and chlorine to all be stable. The calcium atom is the donor, making it positively charged, while the chlorine is the acceptor, making it negatively charged.The number of neutrons and protons in a neutral and ionic atom is always the same, while the electron number always changes. This means that the number of proton and neutron in the calcium after bonding will remain the same. However, the electron number changes to 18 (20 â€“ 2), and the number of electrons for the chlorine atom changes to 18 (17 + 1). This makes both atoms to be stable and happy.Formation of sodium oxide, Na2O.&amp;nbsp;4Na(s) + O2(g)  2Na2O(s)The half equation for the reaction is4Na  4Na+ - 4e-AndO2 + 4e-  O22-Joining both equations, we have that;4Na + O2 + 4e-  4Na+ + O22- - 4e-Cancelling out the electrons on both sides, we have;4Na + O2 &amp;nbsp; 4Na+ + O22-In bond formation, sodium has 11 electrons leaving 1 valence electron for bonding; oxygen however, has 8 electrons, leaving 6 valence electrons for bonding.Therefore, the 2 sodium atoms donate their valence electrons to the oxygen atom available hence making the sodium and oxygen to all be stable. The sodium atom is the donor, making it positively charged, while the oxygen is the acceptor, making it negatively charged.The number of neutrons and protons in a neutral and ionic atom is always the same, while the electron number always changes. This means that the number of proton and neutron in the sodium after bonding will remain the same. However, the electron number changes to 10 (11 â€“ 1), and the number of electrons of the oxygen atom changes to 10 (8 + 2), making both atoms stable and happy.Properties of Electrovalent compounds1. They form ions in water; therefore they dissolve readily in water.2. They conduct electricity because of their dissociation to form ions, thatâ€™s why they are good electrolytes.&amp;nbsp;3. They have high melting and boiling points.&amp;nbsp;4. They occur mainly in inorganic compounds.5. They do not contain molecules.6. They exist mainly as solids at room temperature.&amp;nbsp;COVALENT COMBINATION&amp;nbsp;The main principle in covalent bond is that of sharing of electrons between atoms such that each of the atoms in a molecule has the electron arrangement of a noble gas. Take for instance, Banji has garri and Mensah has sugar they can both join their resources to have garri and sugar. If Fatima sees what is going on between them, she too can decide to bring her groundnut so that they can each have a taste of the entire combination. This is because in themselves the garri, sugar and groundnut isn\\\'t good enough, but as a whole it makes a beautiful meal of garri, sugar and groundnut.&amp;nbsp;Covalent combination occurs between two or more atoms of non - metals involving sharing of electrons to attain stability. Covalent bonding is divided into simple or ordinary covalent bonding and co-ordinate or dative covalent bonding.Ordinary Covalent BondingThis is the combination of two or more non-metals involving equal sharing of electrons to attain stability. The electrons donated for sharing are called shared pair electrons. The number of electrons shared during bonding is determined by the bond type, the bond structure and the bond angle.Nature of Bonds1. Formation of the oxygen moleculeOxygen atoms combine together to share their lone pair of electrons equally amongst themselves, to attain stability. Oxygen has 8 electrons and 6 valence electrons, meaning it needs 2 more electrons, both oxygen atoms share their lone electron pair equally to bring about stability. Before combination the 2 oxygen atoms have 8 electrons each, after combinations they each have 10 electrons making them stable.2. Formation of Ethene moleculeThe carbon atom and hydrogen atom, share their electron pairs equally to form ethene. The carbon atom before combination has six electrons and after combination has 10 electrons&amp;nbsp; and the hydrogen atom too, making them stable.The carbon atom shares 2 of its lone pairs of electrons, and the remaining 2 lone pairs are shared together with the hydrogen atom.COORDINATE/DATIVE COVALENT BONDINGThis is a type of covalent bonding that involves sharing of electrons between two combining atoms which mostly involve the bonding between a molecule and an ion in which the covalent molecule donates electrons for sharing. The electron involved is called the lone pair electrons and it results in the formation of an ion.&amp;nbsp;In the ordinary covalent combinations electrons are shared equally, ie both participants donate equal numbers of electrons, whereas in coordinate covalent combination electrons are donated by only one of the participants.The Nitrogen atom for instance has a lone pair of electrons. It shares this with a proton that is hydrogen ion H+ from an acid to produce the ammonium ions NH4+. In the formation of ammonium ion the proton ie hydrogen ion that combines with the ammonia molecule carries over its positive charge to give ammonium ion.&amp;nbsp;Let\\\'s look at this properly:The formation of ammonium ion involves two stages&amp;nbsp;Stage 1: The formation of ammonium gas&amp;nbsp;Nitrogen bonds with 3 hydrogen atoms to become stable. The nitrogen atom has 7 electrons, meaning it has 5 valence electrons, therefore,&amp;nbsp; it needs a total of 3 electrons to become stable. A hydrogen atom on the other hand needs to either gain an electron or loss an electron to become stable. In this case however, it gains an electron by bonding with nitrogen to become a stable ammonia gas.Note: the bond type is a trigonal bipyramidal and it bond angle is 120OStage 2: The formation of ammonium ionThe ammonia gas formed now combines with a proton that is hydrogen ion. The positive charge on the hydrogen ion is carried over to the ammonia gas to give the positively charged ammonium ion.&amp;nbsp;Note: the bond type is tetrahedral and its bond angle is 109.5O or 109O 28\\\'Properties of Covalent compounds1. They consist of molecules which do not form ions in solution.&amp;nbsp;2. Because they do not form ions they do not conduct electricity and so they are non - electrolytes.3. They have low melting and boiling points.VSEPRThe Valence shell electron pair repulsion theory, or VSEPR states that the shape of a molecule depends on the number of pairs of electrons in the valence shell of the central atom. Electrons are negatively charged particles and the neighboring electrons pairs with each other so that the molecule assumes new positions.&amp;nbsp;In summary we learnt that:Chemical combinations are of two types, the intermolecular bonds and the intramolecular bonds.The electrovalent bonds involve transfer of valence electrons from an electropositive element usually a metal, to an electronegative element usually a non - metal.The covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons. It is divided into simple or ordinary covalent bonding and co-ordinate or dative covalent bonding.I urge you to solve these examples in your spare time.Draw the formation of the following compoundsMagnesium oxide (Mg2+O2-)Calcium fluoride (Ca2+F-)Draw the formation of the following compoundsHydrogen peroxide (H2O2)Hydroxonium ion (H3O+)Phosphoryl chloride (POCl3)Have a lovely day!', 'nil', 'page', '', 1, '', 'b243a432-34a2-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2021-02-24 16:40:44', '', 0);

The atoms of a metal are arranged in such a way that their positive charges and negative charges attract each other as shown here.&amp;nbsp;The presence of metallic bond accounts for the following properties:&amp;nbsp;Malleability that is the ability to beat into shapes.Sonorous nature that is the ability to produce sounds.High melting and boiling points.Ductility that is the ability to be drawn into wire.Magnetic property that is the ability to attract magnet.Electrical and thermal conductivity this is the presence of free electrons.Lustrous nature that is the ability to be polished to shine.High tensile strength.HYDROGEN BONDINGHydrogen bonding is types of dipole to dipole attraction between molecules in which hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative element such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine. Due to differences in electronegativity value, a dipole is induced with hydrogen atom having a partial positive charge while the other has a partial negative charge as seen here.The attraction between the negative charged atoms of a molecule to the positively charged hydrogen atom in another molecule of the same compound forms the hydrogen Bond.Consequences of hydrogen bondingMolecules having hydrogen bonds have high boiling points due to strong intermolecular forces.Molecules with hydrogen bonds are highly soluble in polar solvents such as water.Hydrogen bonding accounts for water resistance.Hydrogen bonding also helps fibers absorb water.Hydrogen bonding explains why water has a high surface tension. The attraction of water molecules on the surface of water makes it behave like an elastic skin that enables insects to walk on it.VAN DER WAAL FORCESThese forces exist between molecules of the same atoms of the same elements. It was discovered by a Dutch scientist called Johannes Vanderwaal. Van der Waals forces are very weak intermolecular forces that exist between molecules of the same atoms of the same element as a result of temporary internal shifts in the distribution of electrons within a molecule. In a molecule of hydrogen gas, as one hydrogen atom pulls electrons leaving a slightly negatively charged hydrogen atom, a temporary dipole is set up in the molecule. It is called temporary because it is short lived and does not last long. A dipole is a pair separated by opposite charges. This temporary dipole in a molecule of hydrogen induces a similar dipole to a nearby hydrogen molecule. There is an attraction between the two molecules due to opposite charges this attraction is called van der waal forces.&amp;nbsp;DIPOLE â€“ DIPOLE INTERACTIONThe dipole - dipole forces of interaction between the negative pole of one molecule and the positive pole of another molecule of an atom between neighboring covalent molecule is due to the differences in electronegativity values. Dipole - dipole interaction of forces occurs mostly in molecules of hydrogen and highly electronegative elements. Elements like HCl and acetone molecules. They are weaker than the polar covalent bonds.Important things to note about dipole â€“ dipole forces:1. Dipole - dipole forces occur between covalent bonds of polar molecules.2. Dipole - dipole forces involves dipoles.3. Dipole - dipole forces form permanent dipole compounds to temporary dipoles of Van Der waals forces.&amp;nbsp;In summary we learnt that:The weak bonds, which are the intramolecular bonds include the:Metallic bonds which occurs in metals.Hydrogen bonds in which hydrogen atoms bond with a highly electronegative element.Van der Waal forces that exist between molecules of the same atoms of the same elements.Dipole - dipole forces of interaction between the negative pole of one molecule and the positive pole of another molecule of an atom.Practice how to identify between these intramolecular forces.See you soon.', 'nil', 'page', '', 1, '', '8c6b49e7-34a4-11eb-b7ac-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2021-02-24 16:40:44', '', 0),

So, let\\\'s just run through the things we have done so far. &amp;nbsp;We define Production as the creation of goods and services\r\nfor the satisfaction of human wants. Or the transformation of raw materials\r\ninto finished or semi-finished goods. Or the creation of utility, while utility\r\nis the satisfaction that we derive from the consumption of goods and services.&amp;nbsp;After that, we looked at the types of goods or the types of\r\nproducts, where we said we have basically two types of goods which are consumer\r\ngoods and producer or capital goods. We defined consumer goods as those that\r\ncan no longer undergo production processes, but are meant for immediate\r\nsatisfaction of human wants, while capital or producer goods are those goods\r\nthat are basically made for the help they will provide in producing other\r\ngoods. They are called producer goods because they are used by producers in\r\nproducing other goods and services. &amp;nbsp;From there, we looked at the types of production where we said\r\nthat production is basically classified into two types, direct and indirect\r\nproduction.

There, we\r\nsaid that the primary aspect of production has to do with everything that\r\nconcerns bringing out raw materials from their natural forms. It includes all\r\nthe extraction activities - mining, extraction of crude oil etc. We looked at\r\nsecondary production that deals with the transformation of raw materials gotten\r\nat the primary level into finished and semi-finished goods and every other\r\nconstruction work.

(17, 0, 4, 1, 53, 5, 'Introduction to Economics', 'e96134bf-361d-11eb-8b83-52540049a927', 'Welcome back!In the first video we watched, we introduced the subject\r\nmatter of economics and I told you that this video will be dedicated to the\r\ndefinition of economics as given by many renowned authors in economics, the\r\nscope of economics, the importance of economics as well as the methodology of\r\neconomics. Then in the next video, we shall be looking at the basic concepts of\r\neconomics. What is economics?Economics has been defined by different authors from their\r\ndifferent perspectives. A lot of definitions of economics have been given and\r\nwe are going to be exploring some of these definitions. According to Adam Smith who is regarded popularly among the\r\neconomists as the father of economics, he defined economics as an inquiry into\r\nthe nature and causes of wealth of nations. Alfred Marshall was also a renowned\r\neconomist. He defined economics as the study of mankind in the ordinary\r\nbusiness of life. According to John Stuart Mill, he defined economics as the\r\npractical science of production and distribution of wealth. All these\r\ndefinitions of economics are very interesting but overtime, there is a\r\nparticular definition that has been general accepted as the most comprehensive\r\ndefinition of economics all around the world. And thatâ€™s the definition given\r\nby professor lord Lionel Robbins who defined economics as the science that\r\nstudies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which\r\nhave alternative uses.First, from Robbins\\\' definition, we can identify some key\r\nconcepts. And one of the key concepts is that economics is a science. That is\r\nvery interesting to understand that economics is a science. For those of you\r\nwho might have appreciated some science subjects, you might have felt that\r\neconomics is not a science. But itâ€™s coming to you now from me that economics\r\nis a science. The question is â€œwhat kind of science is economics?â€&amp;nbsp; because we know that there are many types of\r\nsciences. Economics belongs to the group of science subjects called social\r\nsciences. Economics is a social science subject. Why is it a social science\r\nsubject? It is a social science subject because it studies human behavior. Any\r\nscience subject or any subject that studies human behavior is regarded as a\r\nsocial science. So, economics is regarded as a science because it is a subject\r\nthat uses scientific method to study human behaviours. You know the scientific\r\nmethod for those of you who might have come across it. Scientific method begins\r\nwith problem identification or definition, you come to literature review,\r\nstatement of hypotheses, testing of those hypotheses stated and so on and so\r\nforth. So, economics uses the same scientific method used by pure sciences to\r\ninvestigate economic matters in the society. We have other concepts in the\r\ndefinition of Lionel Robbins that are of much interest. There is a concept of\r\nscarcity in that definition because we have something like the \\&quot;scarce\r\nmeans\\&quot;. The scarce means there is telling us that the means of satisfying\r\nhuman wants are limited. They are scarce in nature. We have another\r\nconcept-ends. Ends in that definition stands for human wants and these human\r\nwants are said to be insatiable. They are said to be too numerous to be\r\nsatisfied with the available resources. Remember we pointed out that these\r\nresources are scarce. Then, the next in that definition is that these scarce\r\nresources have alternative uses. That is to say, since you canâ€™t satisfy all\r\nthe human wants, that means these available resources can be put into different\r\nuses. If you have a list of wants and the resources are not enough to satisfy\r\nall of them at the same time, it then means that you have to choose among those\r\nwants. You have to choose among them the ones youâ€™re going to satisfy first. So\r\nyou see that the definition is very comprehensive and all embracing. So, that\r\nis why it is generally adopted as the most comprehensive definition of\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I encourage you to\r\nlearn other definitions but it is expected that in your examinations, you\r\nshould among other definitions, cite this particular one and when citing it,\r\ntry to point out these key points that he mentioned: Economics as a science i.e\r\na social science because it&amp;nbsp;studies human behavior. Then, it studies human behavior in\r\nits relationship between ends i.e human wants and the scarce means of\r\nsatisfying these wants talking about limited resources.\r\n\r\nSo the next we are going to look at is the scope of\r\neconomics. Economics is generally divided into 2 major branches namely macro\r\nand micro economics. So weâ€™re going to look at the scope of economics within\r\nthis range. Micro economics is that aspect of economics that concerns itself\r\nwith the study of individual economic agents. When I say economic agents, I\r\nmean agents like the household, firms or businesses and the government. These\r\nare the 3 major economic agents we have- the household, the firm and the\r\ngovernment. So what micro economics does is that it singles out each of these\r\neconomic agents to understand how they operate. It doesnâ€™t combine them\r\ntogether to study them. It studies them one after the other as individuals. So\r\nmicro economists can just go into production and decide to study a particular\r\nfirm and its productive activities. So when you talk about the branch of\r\neconomics that deals with the study of the economy in units, we talk about\r\nmicro economics.\r\n\r\nThen the opposite of it is macro economics. As we all know,\r\nthe word macro means large. So, this is the aspect of economics that studies\r\nthe economy as a whole. It combines the different economic units in aggregates\r\nand tries to study them. So, this branch of economics deals with aggregates\r\nlike unemployment, inflation, national income, and so on and so forth.&amp;nbsp; These are aspects of Economics that have to\r\ndo with the whole economy as it is. So economics covers both the micro aspect\r\nof the economy and the macro aspect of the economy. \r\n\r\nThen, we talk about the importance of economics. Economics\r\nis very important because it teaches us scientific ways, scientific principles\r\nthat will help us in the management of our limited resources in trying to\r\nsatisfy our unlimited wants. We have noted here that human wants are insatiable.\r\nThey are too numerous to be satisfied with the available resources. So since\r\nhuman wants are insatiable and resources are limited then there is a problem.\r\nThat problem is how to manage the limited resources in satisfying our unlimited\r\nwants. And that is what economics has come to solve. That problem is what\r\neconomics tries to solve. How do we manage what we have to satisfy our\r\nunlimited wants? So the very essence of economics as a discipline is that it\r\nteaches us scientifically proven ways of using our limited resources\r\nefficiently and effectively in trying to satisfy our unlimited wants. Without\r\nthe study of economics, man would be in a very serious problem trying to\r\nutilize the available resources in meeting his unlimited wants. So you can see\r\nthat economics is very important. Itâ€™s important to an individual, important to\r\na family, very important to firms and even to the government. There is no human\r\nbeing on the face of the earth that the study of economics is not important to\r\nbecause all of us are faced with the problem of scarcity of resources. \r\n\r\nNext we are going to\r\nlook at the methodology of the study of economics. What method do economists\r\napply in their investigations? Remember Iâ€™ve told you that Economics uses the\r\nsame scientific method that other sciences use. The methodology of the study of\r\neconomics is the scientific method, the same scientific method that other\r\nscience subjects use. But one thing about economics is that it does not have a\r\nparticular laboratory like other pure sciences like chemistry, physics and so\r\non and so forth. So economics has the entire society as its own laboratory. And\r\nfunny enough, while other sciences can study animals or non-living things and\r\nsubject them to a particular condition to achieve what they want to achieve, Economics\r\nstudies human beings that cannot be subjected to those scientific control\r\nmeasures. You can see that economists are studying a higher science. It is a\r\nhigher science because itâ€™s dealing with human beings which are higher animals\r\nthat you cannot easily control their behaviours. So when people are trying to\r\nintimidate you with the fact that they are studying science, you can tell them\r\nas well that you are a science student because the course you study or the\r\nsubject you study which is Economics equally uses the same scientific method\r\nthat they use in studying their own pure sciences. In fact, you are even on a\r\nhigher pedestal.&amp;nbsp; The reason is that you\r\nare studying a higher science. So from what we have said so far, we havestudies human behavior. Then, it studies human behavior in\r\nits relationship between ends i.e human wants and the scarce means of\r\nsatisfying these wants talking about limited resources.\r\n\r\nSo the next we are going to look at is the scope of\r\neconomics. Economics is generally divided into 2 major branches namely macro\r\nand micro economics. So weâ€™re going to look at the scope of economics within\r\nthis range.

These\r\nare the 3 major economic agents we have- the household, the firm and the\r\ngovernment. So what micro economics does is that it singles out each of these\r\neconomic agents to understand how they operate. It doesnâ€™t combine them\r\ntogether to study them. It studies them one after the other as individuals. So\r\nmicro economists can just go into production and decide to study a particular\r\nfirm and its productive activities. So when you talk about the branch of\r\neconomics that deals with the study of the economy in units, we talk about\r\nmicro economics.\r\n\r\nThen the opposite of it is macro economics. As we all know,\r\nthe word macro means large. So, this is the aspect of economics that studies\r\nthe economy as a whole. It combines the different economic units in aggregates\r\nand tries to study them. So, this branch of economics deals with aggregates\r\nlike unemployment, inflation, national income, and so on and so forth.&amp;nbsp; These are aspects of Economics that have to\r\ndo with the whole economy as it is. So economics covers both the micro aspect\r\nof the economy and the macro aspect of the economy. \r\n\r\nThen, we talk about the importance of economics. Economics\r\nis very important because it teaches us scientific ways, scientific principles\r\nthat will help us in the management of our limited resources in trying to\r\nsatisfy our unlimited wants. We have noted here that human wants are insatiable.\r\nThey are too numerous to be satisfied with the available resources. So since\r\nhuman wants are insatiable and resources are limited then there is a problem.\r\nThat problem is how to manage the limited resources in satisfying our unlimited\r\nwants. And that is what economics has come to solve. That problem is what\r\neconomics tries to solve. How do we manage what we have to satisfy our\r\nunlimited wants? So the very essence of economics as a discipline is that it\r\nteaches us scientifically proven ways of using our limited resources\r\nefficiently and effectively in trying to satisfy our unlimited wants. Without\r\nthe study of economics, man would be in a very serious problem trying to\r\nutilize the available resources in meeting his unlimited wants. So you can see\r\nthat economics is very important. Itâ€™s important to an individual, important to\r\na family, very important to firms and even to the government. There is no human\r\nbeing on the face of the earth that the study of economics is not important to\r\nbecause all of us are faced with the problem of scarcity of resources. \r\n\r\nNext we are going to\r\nlook at the methodology of the study of economics. What method do economists\r\napply in their investigations? Remember Iâ€™ve told you that Economics uses the\r\nsame scientific method that other sciences use. The methodology of the study of\r\neconomics is the scientific method, the same scientific method that other\r\nscience subjects use. But one thing about economics is that it does not have a\r\nparticular laboratory like other pure sciences like chemistry, physics and so\r\non and so forth. So economics has the entire society as its own laboratory. And\r\nfunny enough, while other sciences can study animals or non-living things and\r\nsubject them to a particular condition to achieve what they want to achieve, Economics\r\nstudies human beings that cannot be subjected to those scientific control\r\nmeasures. You can see that economists are studying a higher science. It is a\r\nhigher science because itâ€™s dealing with human beings which are higher animals\r\nthat you cannot easily control their behaviours. So when people are trying to\r\nintimidate you with the fact that they are studying science, you can tell them\r\nas well that you are a science student because the course you study or the\r\nsubject you study which is Economics equally uses the same scientific method\r\nthat they use in studying their own pure sciences. In fact, you are even on a\r\nhigher pedestal.&amp;nbsp; The reason is that you\r\nare studying a higher science. So from what we have said so far, we have&amp;nbsp;studies human behavior. Then, it studies human behavior in\r\nits relationship between ends i.e human wants and the scarce means of\r\nsatisfying these wants talking about limited resources.\r\n\r\nSo the next we are going to look at is the scope of\r\neconomics. Economics is generally divided into 2 major branches namely macro\r\nand micro economics. So weâ€™re going to look at the scope of economics within\r\nthis range. Micro economics is that aspect of economics that concerns itself\r\nwith the study of individual economic agents. When I say economic agents, I\r\nmean agents like the household, firms or businesses and the government. These\r\nare the 3 major economic agents we have- the household, the firm and the\r\ngovernment.

(18, 0, 4, 1, 53, 5, 'Introduction to Economics Part 1', 'e9616385-361d-11eb-8b83-52540049a927', 'Welcome back! In this segment, we are going to have a recap\r\nof the things we have said so far from the first video to this point. Remember\r\nwe are on the topic, introduction to economics and so far we have looked at the\r\nmeaning of economics, weâ€™ve looked at the various definitions of Economics as\r\noffered by different authorities in Economics.&amp;nbsp;\r\nAnd we have come to the conclusion that the most generally accepted\r\ndefinition among those we have looked at is the one offered by lord Lionel\r\nRobbins which defined economics as the science that studies human behavior as a\r\nrelationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses. And we\r\nhave equally pointed out the key concepts in that definition like the concept of\r\nwants which he referred to as ends, the concept of scarcity, the concept of\r\nchoice that is talking about alternative uses.So beyond the definition of Economics, we looked at the\r\nscope of Economics where we said that we are going to constrain ourselves within\r\nthe range of two major branches of economics. i.e the macro and micro aspects\r\nof Economics. So we said that Economics covers both the macro aspect and the\r\nmicro aspect and we said that the micro aspect of Economics deals with the\r\nstudy of individual economic agents or the study of economic units while the\r\nmacro aspect has to do with the study of the economy as a whole i.e the\r\napplication of the various units to study them as one. So the macro aspect of\r\neconomics has to do with those aspects of Economics that have to do with the\r\nwhole economy. Aspects of Economics that have something to do with the whole\r\neconomy like inflation, unemployment, national income and so on and so forth.\r\nSo we went ahead to talk about the importance of economics. And we mentioned\r\nthat economics is very important because it tries to proffer solution to the\r\nproblem of scarcity. So the major reason for the study of economics is to solve\r\nthe problem of scarcity of resources and that is why economics is very\r\nimportant because every human being on the face of the earth faces the problem\r\nof scarcity of resources. And next we talked about the methodology of the study\r\nof economics and we agreed that like any other science subject, Economics uses\r\nthe scientific method to carry out all its investigations. So that is to say,\r\nthat like other scientists, economists apply the scientific method in carrying\r\nout their economic investigations. So take note of that. Economics though it is\r\nsocial science, it uses scientific method in carrying out all its\r\ninvestigations. So after that, we looked at the basic concepts of economics. We\r\nlooked at the concept of wants, the concept of scarcity, the concept of scale\r\nof preference, the concept of choice and finally the concept of opportunity\r\ncost and we mentioned that all of them are very important. There is none that\r\nis more important than the other.&amp;nbsp;So, I thank you very\r\nmuch for following the videos and paying attention and I believe you have\r\nunderstood a lot of things even at this introductory level and have been\r\nmotivated to seek more knowledge on the subject, Economics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I want you to go through the exercise questions provided\r\nand see how much you have appreciated the things we have taught. Try to answer\r\nthe questions on your own and see things foro yourself. See how much of the\r\nthings we have taught you so far youâ€™ve been able to learn. And Iâ€™m very proud\r\nyouâ€™re becoming a better economist even at this introductory level. I believe\r\nyou have been motivated to even make Economics a compulsory subject for\r\nyourself. Iâ€™ll be waiting for you even in the next topic we are going to treat.\r\nThank you!', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhLsjui2wr8&amp;ab_channel=ACADASUITEEconomics', 'page', '', 1, '', '3f2c7e26-3621-11eb-8b83-52540049a927', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', '1970-01-01 01:00:00', 0, 0, 0, '2020-12-04 11:09:58', '', 0),
